We have written generally to all, since we know this case pertains to persons of every order, and we are prevented by the aforesaid adjuration from betraying those who transmitted the proposals to us.  So, may the Lord give a direct and well-sounding word to our mouth, so that, concerning those things we were asked about, we may be able to proffer to suitably collected words of those to whom the Lord said: ‘For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you’ [Matthew 10:20].  May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, who wants all men to be saved and wants no one to perish, grant that the words of the saints excerpted through the service of our humility may be pleasing in the sight of those hearing them, to whom God says generally: ‘He that is of God heareth God’s words’ [John 8:47], and who said to his disciples ‘He that heareth you heareth me’. May He who ordered the stone to be removed from the tomb of Lazarus remove the hardness of disobedience from the inner hearing of the hearts of all those hearing. May He who formerly promised through the prophets that ‘I will take away the stony heart our of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgements, and do them’ [Ezekiel 36:26], bear away the senselessness of the disobedient, lest (may it not happen) to those despising the counsels of his saints (to whom He said: ‘He that despiseth you, despiseth me’ [Luke 10:16]), He may say what is very terrible, ‘ye therefore hear them not’ (that is do not obey), ‘because ye are not of God’ [John 8:37].

We do not wish to dispute uncertain things at length, since we can instead bring forth certain things from the authority of the Scriptures. For concerning exhortation to confession, we read that it is written: ‘Reveal thy way unto the Lord, and trust in Him’ [Psalms 36:5]. And on exhortation to a subsequent confession, we again read: ‘I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord, and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin’ [Psalms 31:5]. The Lord proffers forgiveness, not punishment, to a confession that is not extorted by fear, but rather brought forth in hope of indulgence through medicinal encouragement, as again he [the Psalmist] says: ‘And of my own will shall I confess to Him’ [Psalms 27:7]; a confession which is not induced by present glory, but by future bliss, since it is written: ‘It is vain for you to rise before light, rise after you have sat, you that eat the bread of sorrows’ [Psalm 126:2]. For ‘he rises before the light who, separating himself from God’s care by neglecting his commands, falls, and who puts seeking to be exalted with honours and to profit in this life, which is similar to night, before the day of the world to come’. ‘So first we should sit in penitence, so that afterwards we may rightly arise through mercy, since whoever does not willingly humble himself through penitence will not be exalted by the coming glory.’
